# Lesson 4 - Strings

## Recap 1: Sushi Checkout

# You just had a lunch at a sushi restaurant and have to
# calculate the total amount you have spent. Different coloured
# plates costs different as shown below:

# Red = 1
# Blue = 2
# Green = 3

# You have ordered a total of 3 red plates, 5 blue plates, and 4
# green plates.

# Calculate and print the total amount you have spent: -->
# r_amount = Red*3
# b_amount = Blue*5
# g_amount = Green*4
# ans = r_amount + b_amount + g_amount
# print(ans)
## Task 1: Storing and printing Strings

# **Task 1a**:
# Use the input() function to ask the user for their name and
# store it in a variable. Then print that variable.
# username = input("enter your name: ")
# print(username)
# **Task 1b**:
# Ask the user for their favorite colour using input() and
# store the response in a variable. Print the variable.
# colour = input("enter your favourite colour: ")
# print(colour)
# **Task 1c**:
# Ask the user for their age using input() and store the answer
# in a variable. Print the variable.
# age = input("enter your age: ")
# print(age)


## Task 2: Input & string concatenation

# **Task 2a**:
# Ask the user for their name using input() and store it in a
# variable. 
# Concatenate the name with "Hi, [name]!" and print the
# complete message.
# name = input("what is your name: ")
# print ("Hi,"+name+"!")
# # **Task 2b**:
# # Use input() to ask the user for their favorite hobby. Store this
# # in a variable.
# # Print a message saying "I enjoy [hobby]" using string
# # concatenation.
# hobby = input("enter your favourite hobby: ")
# print ("I like "+hobby)
# # **Task 2c**:
# # Ask the user for their dream vacation destination using input()
# # and store it in a variable.
# # Concatenate this variable with a phrase like "I would love to
# # visit" and print the full sentence.
# vacation = input("enter your dream vacation: ")
# print ("I would like to visit " +vacation)

# **Task 3a**:
# 1. Ask the user for their current age using input(). Convert this
# to an integer.
# 2. Add 1 to their age and convert it back to a string.
# 3. Then print a message saying "Next year, you will be [age+1]
# years old."

age

# **Task 3b**:
# 1. Use input() to ask the user for a number. Convert this number
# from a string to an integer.
# 2. Double the number and convert it back to a string.
# 3. Print "Double your number is [double the number]".

# **Task 3c**:
# 1. Use input() to ask the user for the year they were born and
# convert it to an integer.
# 2. Subtract the birth year from the current year (assume the
# current year as an integer) to find their age.
# 3. Convert the age back to a string and print "You are [age]
# years old".
