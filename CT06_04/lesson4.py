# Lesson 4 - Strings

## Recap 1: Sushi Checkout

# You just had a lunch at a sushi restaurant and have to
# calculate the total amount you have spent. Different coloured
# plates costs different as shown below:

Red = 1
Blue = 2
Green = 3

# You have ordered a total of 3 red plates, 5 blue plates, and 4
# green plates.

# Calculate and print the total amount you have spent: -->
r_amount = Red*3
b_amount = Blue*5
g_amount = Green*4
ans = r_amount + b_amount + g_amount
print(ans)
