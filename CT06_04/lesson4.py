# Lesson 4 - Strings

## Recap 1: Sushi Checkout

# You just had a lunch at a sushi restaurant and have to
# calculate the total amount you have spent. Different coloured
# plates costs different as shown below:

Red = 1
Blue = 2
Green = 3

# You have ordered a total of 3 red plates, 5 blue plates, and 4
# green plates.

# Calculate and print the total amount you have spent: -->
r_amount = Red*3
b_amount = Blue*5
g_amount = Green*4
ans = r_amount + b_amount + g_amount
print(ans)
## Task 1: Storing and printing Strings

# **Task 1a**:
# Use the input() function to ask the user for their name and
# store it in a variable. Then print that variable.
username = input("enter your name: ")
print(username)
# **Task 1b**:
# Ask the user for their favorite colour using input() and
# store the response in a variable. Print the variable.
colour = input("enter your favourite colour: ")
print(colour)
# **Task 1c**:
# Ask the user for their age using input() and store the answer
# in a variable. Print the variable.
age = input("enter your age: ")
print(age)


## Task 2: Input & string concatenation

# **Task 2a**:
# Ask the user for their name using input() and store it in a
# variable. 
# Concatenate the name with "Hi, [name]!" and print the
# complete message.
print = input("what s")
# **Task 2b**:
# Use input() to ask the user for their favorite hobby. Store this
# in a variable.
# Print a message saying "I enjoy [hobby]" using string
# concatenation.

# **Task 2c**:
# Ask the user for their dream vacation destination using input()
# and store it in a variable.
# Concatenate this variable with a phrase like "I would love to
