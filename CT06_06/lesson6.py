# Lesson 6 - Debugging

## Recap 1: Class Average Calculator

# You have been tasked to create a programme that calculates the
# average marks of a class.

# Your programme will have to ask the
# user for the total number of students, followed by the marks of
# each student one at a time.

# Use only variables, math operators that you have learnt, as# well as a 'for' loop
# numStudents = int(input("how many students are there "))
# sum = 0
# for i in range(1,numStudents+1):
#     sum=sum+int(input("what is student #" + "'s score"))
# print("My sum is: " + str(sum)) 
# print("my average is; " +str(sum/ numStudents))

## Task 1: Syntax Errors
# Fix the errors in the following:

# **Task 1a**:
# for i in range(3):
    # print("Hello, World!")

# **Task 1b**:
# for i in range(5):
    # print(i)

# **Task 1c**:
# print("Hello, World!")

# **Task 1d**:
# hi - 5

# **Task 1e**:
#  print("Hello, World!")

 ## Task 2: Name Errors
# Fix the errors in the following:

# **Task 2a**:
print("age")

# **Task 2b**:
name = "Alice"
print(name)

# **Task 2c**:
print(x)
x = 5

# **Task 2d**:
pint("Hello, World!")
