## Recap 1: Automated Birthday Invitation

# You run a small business that creates personalized digital
# birthday invitation cards. To automate the process, you decide
# to write a Python program. 

# This program should ask the user for:
# 1. birthday person's name
# 2. the age that they are turning that year
# 3. personal message from the sender

# Finally, the program prints out a personalized invitation
# message.

# ### Sample output:
# "Happy <Age>th birthday
Name=input("tell me your name:  ")
print(Name)
age=input("what age are you turning this year:  ")
print(age)
message=input("what do you want me to send:  ")
print(message)
print("my name is "(Name))
