# Lesson 6 - Debugging

## Recap 1: Class Average Calculator

# You have been tasked to create a programme that calculates the
# average marks of a class.

# Your programme will have to ask the
# user for the total number of students, followed by the marks of
# each student one at a time.

# Use only variables, math operators that you have learnt, as# well as a 'for' loop
# numStudents = int(input("how many students are there "))
# sum = 0
# for i in range(1,numStudents+1):
#     sum=sum+int(input("what is student #" + "'s score"))
# print("My sum is: " + str(sum)) 
# print("my average is; " +str(sum/ numStudents))

## Task 1: Syntax Errors
# Fix the errors in the following:

# **Task 1a**:
# for i in range(3):
    # print("Hello, World!")

# **Task 1b**:
# for i in range(5):
    # print(i)

# **Task 1c**:
# print("Hello, World!")

# **Task 1d**:
# hi - 5

# **Task 1e**:
#  print("Hello, World!")

#  ## Task 2: Name Errors
# # Fix the errors in the following:

# # **Task 2a**:
# age = 1
# print(age)

# # **Task 2b**:
# name = "Alice"
# print(name)

# # **Task 2c**:
# x = 5
# print(x)


# # **Task 2d**:
# print("Hello, World!")


## Task 3: Type Errors
# Fix the errors in the following:

# **Task 3a**:
age = 25
print(age + 1)

# **Task 3b**:
number = 10
print(number - 5)

# **Task 3c**:
print("Repeat" * 3)

# **Task 3d**:
Year = 2023
print("The year is "+ Year)

# **Task 3e**:
x = 10
y = x / 2

# **Task 3f**:
end = "5"
for i in range(end):
    print(i)
